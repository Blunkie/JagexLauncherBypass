# JagexLauncherBypass
cmd files to switch out the runelite for a third party client

Devious and Meteor are the ones currently availble however Devious is what ive worked on the most currently

Devious copy assumes you have downloaded devious once  
the download downloads the launcher and puts it in runelite appdata folder

i plan to make it a multiple choice 0 makes it normal runelite 1 devious and 2 meteor  
however that is still in the works
