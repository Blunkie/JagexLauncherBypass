cmd files to switch out the runelite for a third party client

Run first devious to appdata and to switch between runelite and devious run the switch file

Devious and Meteor are the ones currently availble however Devious is what ive worked on the most currently

Devious to runelite appdata
downloads the launcher if it doesnt detect it in your downloads otherwise just copies it over
would like feedback on if you would prefer it deletes from downloads after or not

i plan to make it a multiple choice 0 makes it normal runelite 1 devious and 2 meteor  
however that is still in the works
