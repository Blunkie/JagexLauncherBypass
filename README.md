# JagexLauncherBypass

This repository contains a set of cmd files that enable users to easily switch between different third-party clients, including Runelite, Devious, and Meteor.

## Usage

To switch to the Devious client:

1. Download the `client-switcher.bat` cmd file.
2. Execute the `client-switcher.bat` file, which will automatically download the Devious client if it's not already on the system and switch to it. If the Devious client is downloaded for the first time, you will need to run the `client-switcher.bat` file again to switch to it.

A multi-client switcher that supports more than one client is currently under development.
The cmd files can switch between Runelite and Devious clients.

## Compatibility

Currently, these cmd files are only compatible with Windows operating systems. However, we are working on creating scripts for Mac OS as well.

## Supported Clients

Currently, the cmd files support switching between Runelite and Devious clients. However, we are committed to updating and expanding support for more free third-party clients as they become available. A multi-client switcher thats supports more clients is also in development.
