This repository contains a set of cmd files that enable users to easily switch between different third-party clients, including Runelite, Devious, and Meteor. 

## Usage

To switch to the Devious client: 

1. Download the `client-switcher.bat` cmd file.
2. Execute the `client-switcher.bat` file, which will automatically download the Devious client if it's not already on the system and switch to and from it.

Alternatively, you can use these two cmd files to switch to Devious client: 

1. Download the `Devious to runelite appdata.cmd` file and execute it. This will move the required files to the AppData folder of your system. 
2. After this, you can use the `Runelite Client Switch.cmd` file to switch between Runelite and Devious clients.

To switch to the Meteor client: 

1. Download the `Meteor to appdata.cmd` file and execute it. This will move the required files to the AppData folder of your system. 
2. Afterwards, you can use the `Meteor Runelite Switch.cmd` file to switch between Runelite and Meteor clients. 

Please note that the Meteor client is still a work in progress and currently does not work. However, a multi-client switcher that supports Meteor is currently under development.

## Compatibility 

Currently, these cmd files are only compatible with Windows operating systems. However, we are working on creating scripts for Mac OS as well.

## Supported Clients 

Currently, the cmd files support switching only between Runelite and Devious clients. However, we are committed to updating and expanding support for more free third-party clients as they become available. A multi-client switcher is also in development.
