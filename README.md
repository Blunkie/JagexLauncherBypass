# JagexLauncherBypass
I have created .cmd files that allow you to switch between Runelite and a third-party client for ease of use.

To start using the Devious client, simply run the '[Devious to runelite appdata.cmd](https://github.com/ZorbakScape/JagexLauncherBypass/blob/main/Devious%20to%20runelite%20appdata.cmd)' file, which will move the required files to the AppData folder. After this you can run the '[Devious Runelite Switch.cmd](https://github.com/ZorbakScape/JagexLauncherBypass/blob/main/Devious%20Runelite%20Switch.cmd)' file to switch between Runelite and Devious.

Currently, we have Devious client switching available, And Meteor is being worked on.

When using the Devious appdata file, the .cmd file will check if the launcher is available in your Downloads folder. If it doesn't detect the launcher there, it will download the launcher for you. Otherwise, it will copy it to the appropriate location. Please provide us with feedback on whether you prefer the downloaded launcher to be deleted automatically after it has been moved.

i plan to make it a multiple choice 0 makes it normal runelite 1 devious and 2 meteor  
however that is still in the works
