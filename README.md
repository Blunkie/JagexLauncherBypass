I have created .cmd files that allow you to switch between Runelite and third-party clients for ease of use.

To start using the Devious client, download the 'client-switcher.bat' cmd file and execute this it will switch if the devious is in the appdata if it isnt it will download it and you will need to run it again to switch or you can use the older files that do this in 2 files rather then 1 intructions for this are below 
  
download the 'Devious to runelite appdata.cmd' cmd file and execute it. This will move the required files to the AppData folder of your system. After this, you can use 'Runelite Client Switch.cmd' to switch between Runelite and Devious clients.

Similarly, to use the Meteor client, execute 'Meteor to appdata.cmd' to move the relevant files to the AppData folder. Afterwards, you can use the 'Meteor Runelite Switch.cmd' to switch between Runelite and Meteor clients.

This script is currently only compatible with Windows. However, I am currently working on creating scripts for Mac operating systems as well.

Currently, I have Devious and Meteor client switching available. I will work on adding support for more free third-party clients as they become available.
