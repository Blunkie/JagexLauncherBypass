I have created .cmd files that allow you to switch between Runelite and a third-party client for ease of use.

To start using the Devious client, simply run the 'Devious to runelite appdata.cmd' file, which will move the required files to the AppData folder. After this you can run the 'Devious Runelite Switch.cmd' file to switch between Runelite and Devious.

Same thing with meteor client run the Meteor to appdata first then the switcher will do the work for you

Currently, we have Devious and Meteor client switching available, More will be worked on as more free clients appear
